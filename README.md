### Introduction

This is a conference celebrating three mathematicians who spent their careers at University of Hawaii: Ralph Freese, Bill Lampe, and J.B.Nation.

---

### Program

---

### Contributed Talks 

#### Submission Information

We will referee short papers (up to 6 pages long, with possible extra 2 pages for references, tables, graphs, or pictures) and publish them ~~with the University of Hawaii publishing service~~ around the start of the conference, in May 2018. Long versions of the papers may be submitted later to a special issue of Algebra Universalis. (Of course, you may submit your paper to a different journal, if you wish.)

A short paper is not equivalent to an extended abstract of a proposed talk, and should contain new results which are proved, or new survey material. Papers may be submitted even if the author cannot attend the conference. 

If you plan to give a talk at the conference and prefer to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages long) instead of a paper, then you need not submit via EasyChair; you may simply send it as an email attachment to the conference email address, [algebraslatticeshawaii2018@gmail.com](algebraslatticeshawaii2018@gmail.com). Extended abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings, but will available on the conference web-site.

#### Submission Deadline

**UPDATE:** Following the multiple requests, the submission deadline is extended to **February 20, 2018**.

Applications for contributed talks begin in November 2017 via EasyChair.  Please use the following link to submit your short paper or extended abstract:

### Parking on UH campus

If you plan to attend the conference, please send us a confirmation, and please **indication if you will need parking on campus** (this request is urgent, and we need to receive your confirmation before Monday).

If you rent a car during your travel to Hawaii, and you will need day or overnight parking on the campus for the days of the conference, you need to request it now.

We have been informed by the university parking office that we need to pay event parking early this week (week of May 7), otherwise, parking on the campus will be impossible for participants. 
Thus, we need to make a careful count of all of you who will need parking passes.

An all day/all night pass is $5/day on weekdays and $6/day on Saturdays (Sunday is free parking anywhere on campus).

Please, send us a note immediately if you will need the parking during the conference days May 22--24, and we will make an advance payment for the parking passes for you. If you order the passes, the cost will be added to your registration fee.

### Banquet
The banquet is on Wednesday, May 23, at 7:00 pm at [Willows](http://willowshawaii.com/) [http://willowshawaii.com/](http://willowshawaii.com/)




If you have any questions concerning your travel to Hawaii, your accommodation or request related to your planned presentation, please, do not hesitate to send us a message. The weather in Hawaii is usually very pleasant, and many of you heard of Kilauea eruption on the Big Island. We expect the flow of tourists to increase in the coming days. If you did not see lava before, maybe it is your big chance to see it when visiting Big Island after the conference.



Wishing you a good end of academic year and a smooth travel to the mid-point of Pacific,
