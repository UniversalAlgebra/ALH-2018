## Contributed Talks 

### Submission Information

We will referee short papers (up to 6 pages long, with possible extra 2 pages for references, tables, graphs, or pictures) and publish them ~~with the University of Hawaii publishing service~~ around the start of the conference, in May 2018. Long versions of the papers may be submitted later to a special issue of Algebra Universalis. (Of course, you may submit your paper to a different journal, if you wish.)

A short paper is not equivalent to an extended abstract of a proposed talk, and should contain new results which are proved, or new survey material. Papers may be submitted even if the author cannot attend the conference. 

If you plan to give a talk at the conference and prefer to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages long) instead of a paper, then you need not submit via EasyChair; you may simply send it as an email attachment to the conference email address, [algebraslatticeshawaii2018@gmail.com](algebraslatticeshawaii2018@gmail.com). Extended abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings, but will available on the conference web-site.

### Submission Deadline

**UPDATE:** Following the multiple requests, the submission deadline is extended to **February 20, 2018**.

Applications for contributed talks begin in November 2017 via EasyChair.  Please use the following link to submit your short paper or extended abstract:

### Parking on UH campus
If you plan to attend the conference, please send us a confirmation, and please **indication if you will need parking on campus** (this request is urgent, and we need to receive your confirmation before Monday, May 7).

If you rent a car during your travel to Hawaii, and you will need day or overnight parking on the campus for the days of the conference, you need to request it now.

We have been informed by the university parking office that we need to pay event parking early this week (week of May 7), otherwise, parking on the campus will be impossible for participants. 
Thus, we need to make a careful count of all of you who will need parking passes.

An all day/all night pass is $5/day on weekdays and $6/day on Saturdays (Sunday is free parking anywhere on campus).

Please, send us a note immediately if you will need the parking during the conference days May 22--24, and we will make an advance payment for the parking passes for you. If you order the passes, the cost will be added to your registration fee.

**East-West Center Housing Parking.** If you will be staying at East-West Center Housing (Lincoln Hall), then you can call the
[East-West Center Housing Office](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/about-ewc/housing/conference-housing)
at (808) 944-7805 and ask to have a parking pass reserved for you. These passes are $5/day and permit you to park in the [lower campus parking structure](https://goo.gl/maps/a46GWXBsqRB2).  The walk from the parking structure to both the Math Department and Lincoln Hall takes 10 minutes.  (After hours and weekends, these parking passes should allow you to park in upper campus lots, which are much more convenient.)  If you have East-West Center reserve a parking pass for you, then you will have to pick up the pass at the Parking Office which is on the lower level of the [Queen Liliu'okalani Center](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/commuter/contactus.php) (Hours: M--F, 7:45am--4:30pm).

## Further Information

If you have any questions concerning your travel to Hawaii, your accommodation or request related to your planned presentation, please, do not hesitate to send us a message.

The weather in Hawaii is warm and usually pleasant. You may have heard of Kilauea erupting on the Big Island, which is about 200 miles away from Oahu (where the conference will be held).  So far, the volcano has had no impact on Oahu and we don't forsee any problems arising at UH Manoa from volcanic activity on the Big Island.
