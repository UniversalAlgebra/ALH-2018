### Contributed Talks 
**UPDATE:** Following the multiple requests, the submission deadline is extended to **February 20, 2018**.

Applications for contributed talks begin in November 2017 via EasyChair.  Please use the following link to submit your short paper or extended abstract:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alhawaii2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alhawaii2018)
 

**SUBMISSION DEADLINE:** The deadline for submitting papers to the Algebra and Lattices in Hawaii-2018 Conference Proceedings is ~~February 15~~ **February 20, 2018**. 

This is a conference celebrating three mathematicians who spent their careers at University of Hawaii: Ralph Freese, Bill Lampe, and J.B.Nation.

We will referee short papers (up to 6 pages long, with possible extra 2 pages for references, tables, graphs, or pictures) and publish them with the University of Hawaii publishing service around the start of the conference, in May 2018. Long versions of the papers may be submitted later to a special issue of Algebra Universalis (or another journal of your choice).

A short paper is not equivalent to an extended abstract of a proposed talk, and should contain new results which are proved, or new survey material. Papers may be submitted even if the author cannot attend the conference. 

If you plan to give a talk at the conference and prefer to submit an extended abstract (1-2 pages long) instead of a paper, then you need not submit via EasyChair; you may simply send your abstract as an email attachment to the conference email address, [algebraslatticeshawaii2018@gmail.com](algebraslatticeshawaii2018@gmail.com). Extended abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings, but will available on the conference web-site.

Submission of contributed papers should be made via Easy Chair using the
