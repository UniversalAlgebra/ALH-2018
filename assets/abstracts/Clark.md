**Title.** Asymptotic Properties of Finite Groupoids

**Abstract.**  Recent work has shown that randomizing algorithms drawn from the methods of evolutionary computation can efficiently find a term representing a given term operation on an idemprimal groupoid provided the groupoid has two other properties:  NSR and AC.  This work motivates a deeper study of these two properties which prove to be worthy of investigation quite apart from their application to these algorithms.
