**Abstract.**
Starting from famous Malcev conference in Novosibirsk in 1989, the author describes the stride to approach the solution of Birkhoff-Malcev problem, where Ralph, JB and Bill all made their contribution. With JB Nation in particular, since R. Mckenzie's conference in 2002, it went into publishing uncountably many joint papers and finitely many chapters in the volume 2 of Lattice Theory: Special Topics and Applications (2016), edited by G.Gr√§tzer and F. Wehrung. Surprisingly, the byproducts of this stride were as valuable as the the progress in Birkhoff-Malcev problem itself, bringing understanding to infinite convex geometries, and new applications in data science among others.
