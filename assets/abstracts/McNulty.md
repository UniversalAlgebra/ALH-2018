**Abstract.** The elementary theory of the  lattice $\mathcal L_{\Delta}$ of all equational theories of signature $\Delta$ was shown to be undecidable in 1975 by Burris and Sankappanavar, provided the signature $\Delta$ is large in the sense that it provides at least one operation symbol of rank at least two or else provides at least two operation symbols of rank one. Indeed, they show that the elementary theory is hereditarily undecidable.

It is our object, in this study, to bring this result more sharply into focus.  At the center of 
the reasoning of Burris and Sankappanavar is the fact, established by Burris in 1971, that the lattice of all equivalence relations on any given finite set can be embedded as an interval in $\mathcal L_{\Delta}$, for all large signatures $\Delta$.

By an old result of Sachs (1961), this means that the equational theory of such $\mathcal L_{\Delta}$ is the same as the equational theory of the variety  of all lattices. This equational theory, the equational theory of lattices, was shown to be decidable by Thoralf Skolem in 1920, a result later rediscovered by Whitman  in 1941.

Thus,  the *equational theory* of $\mathcal L_{\Delta}$ is decidable, but its *elementary theory* is undecidable.

In an effort to find the point along the spectrum from the equational theory to
the elementary theory where undecidability enters, we offer here three further
proofs of the undecidability of $\mathcal L_{\Delta}$.  They rely on the substantial
body of work concerning elementary definability in $\mathcal L_{\Delta}$ accomplished 
by Jaroslav Jezek in the decade following the theorem of Burris and Sankappanvar.
