**Title.** Hawai'ian Excursions into Equational Logic

**Speaker.** George F. McNulty

**Institution.** Department of Mathematics, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC

**Abstract.** 
I will talk about the impact of the work of Bill Lampe, Ralph Freese, and JB Nation on equational logic.  While this talk will set some  well-known results in the context of equational logic and will pose some open problems, the talk will not explain how to lecture in barefeet, how to give your doctoral students the fatherly advice they need on the streets of Mexico City, where to go on your honeymoon, nor the relationship between fluid consumption and mathematical progress. But I will talk about natural undecidable equational theories, finite height (or depth, really), inherently nonfinitely based lattices, and zippers.
