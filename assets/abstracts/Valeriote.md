**Title:** Deciding Maltsev conditions

**Speaker:** Matt Valeriote, McMaster University

**Abstract:** I will discuss results dealing with determining the computational complexity of the problem of deciding if a given finite algebra satisfies a particular Maltsev condition or not.  For a given strong Maltsev condition, this problem can be shown to lie in the class EXP-time and in general the problem will be EXP-time complete.  In work with R. Freese, we establish EXP-time completeness for a number of familiar Maltsev conditions and also show that if the problem is restricted to idempotent algebras, some of these problems can be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. Recently, these results have been extended in various directions, and I will present some of the following in my talk.

**Theorem:** For A a finite idempotent algebra,  
1. the following can be decided by polynomial-time algorithms:
   - For a given n, deciding if V(A) generates an n-permutable variety (with R. Willard).
   - For a given n, deciding if V(A) has a sequence of n Jonsson terms, or Gumm terms (with A. Kazda).
   - Deciding if V(A) has a difference term (with W. DeMeo, R. Freese).
2. The problem of deciding if A has a minority term is in NP (with A. Kazda and J. Oprsal).
3. The problem of deciding if A has a semilattice term is EXP-time complete (with R. Freese and JB Nation)
