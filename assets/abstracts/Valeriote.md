**Abstract.**
In the 1990's several researchers, including Ralph Freese, Emil Kiss, and the speaker, produced various versions of a software package that is now known as UACalc.  In addition to being a very useful research tool for investigating finite algebras (I can't recall the last time that I had to compute the labelled congruence lattice of a finite algebra by hand), it also raised several interesting questions about the computational complexity of testing for certain properties of finite algebras and the varieties that they generate.

I plan to talk about the role of the UH group in the development of computational tools for studying algebras and lattices and then will focus on a set of questions and results about the complexity of testing for certain Maltsev conditions that were in part motivated by using UACalc and that have helped to expand the scope of the calculator.
