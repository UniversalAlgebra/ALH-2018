**Abstract.** Starting with $$\Omega$$-sets where $$\Omega$$ is a complete lattice, we introduce the notion of an $$\Omega$$-algebra.  This is a classical algebra equipped  with an $$\Omega$$-valued equality replacing the ordinary one. In these new structures identities hold as appropriate lattice-theoretic formulas.  Our investigation is related to weak congruences of the basic algebra to which a generalized equality is associated. Namely every $$\Omega$$-algebra uniquely determines a closure system in the lattice of weak congruences of the basic algebra. By this correspondence we formulate a representation theorem for $$\Omega$$-algebras.
