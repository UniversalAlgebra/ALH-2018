**Abstract.** 
The lattice $$L_V(\mathbf{QS})$$ of subvarieties of the variety $$\mathbf{QS}$$ of quasi-Stone algebras ordered by inclusion is an $$\omega +1$$ chain.

It is shown that the lattice  $$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{0,1}})$$ of subquasivarieties of the variety $$\mathbf{Q_{0,1}}$$ is a $$4$$-element chain (where $$\mathbf{Q_{0,1}}$$ is the variety of height $$3$$ in $$L_V(\mathbf{QS})$$),
$$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{2,0}})$$ is a finite non-modular lattice (where $$\mathbf{Q_{2,0}}$$ is the variety of height $$4$$),
$$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{3,0}})$$ is still a finite lattice (where $$\mathbf{Q_{3,0}}$$ is the variety of height $$7$$),
whilst $$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{2,1}})$$ is a countably infinite  lattice of finite breadth, thereby satisfying a non-trivial lattice identity, and is locally finite (where $$\mathbf{Q_{2,1}}$$ is the variety of height $$8$$).  In the process, the critical algebras in $$\mathbf{Q_{2,1}}$$ are completely determined.

It is further shown that $$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{1,2}})$$ is finite-to-finite relatively universal
(in the sense of Hedrl\'{\i}n and Pultr), hence, it is uncountable and does not have finite breadth (where $$\mathbf{Q_{1,2}}$$ is the variety of height $$9$$). Furthermore, it is shown that $$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{1,2}})$$ is not $$Q$$-universal (in the sense of Sapir), thereby showing false a long-standing conjecture that every finite-to-finite relatively universal variety is $$Q$$-universal.

Finally, it is shown that
 the variety $$\mathbf{Q_{2,2}}$$ (of height $$13$$) is
finite-to-finite universal and, hence,
$$Q$$-universal. It follows, for example, that the lattice $$L_Q(\mathbf{Q_{2,2}})$$ has a free lattice on a countably infinite set of generators as a sublattice (thereby failing every non-trivial lattice identity).

No proper subvariety of $$\mathbf{Q_{1,2}}$$ is finite-to-finite relatively universal to any of its proper subvarieties, nor is any proper subvariety of $$\mathbf{Q_{2,2}}$$ universal.
