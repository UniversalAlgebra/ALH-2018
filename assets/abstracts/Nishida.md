**Title.** Primer of Quasivariety Lattices

**Speaker.** Joy N. Nishida

**Abstract.** The lattice of subquasivarieties of a quasivariety can be 
represented as the lattice $$\operatorname S_p (\mathbf L,H)$$ of 
$$H$$-closed algebraic subsets of an algebraic lattice $$\mathbf L$$ 
with a monoid $$H$$ of operators.  This representation is used to develop new restrictions on the equational closure operator.  A method that enables us to 
represent some finite lattices as lattices of subquasivarieties is described.
