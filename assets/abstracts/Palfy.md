**Abstract.**
On the poster of the conference we see Bill, JB and Ralph looking at a blackboard showing a particular 7-element lattice. This is the smallest lattice that is not known to be representable as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra (William DeMeo's Thesis, UH, 2012).

Although I am not able to solve the representation problem for this lattice, I will show how to reduce the problem to representing finite lattices as intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups of two particular types: (1) almost simple groups; (2) twisted wreath products with peculiar properties. This is based on works of Baddeley, Lucchini, Börner, Aschbacher, and Shareshian. Twisted wreath products were introduced by B. H. Neumann in 1963. I will indicate how naturally this group theoretic construction arises and what relevance it has for the finite congruence lattice representation problem.
