**Abstract.**
The problem whether every finite lattice is representable as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra has been reduced to a group theoretic question: whether every finite lattice occurs as an interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group. Based on works of R. Baddeley, A. Lucchini, F. Borner, J. Shareshian, and M.Aschbacher the problem can be further reduced to two particular cases: intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups where the group is either almost simple or a twisted wreath product of a restricted type. So the group theoretic construction of twisted wreath products introduced by B. H. Neumann in 1963 seems to play a crucial role in dealing with the finite congruence lattice problem.
