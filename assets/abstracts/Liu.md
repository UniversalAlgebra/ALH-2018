**Abstract.**
Champarnaud and Pin (1989) found the maximum complexity, in terms of finite automata, of a Boolean function on n variables. We study the special case of monotone functions. It is inspired by an application to complexity of financial securities. Mathematically we relate it to a certain lattice homomorphism problem.
