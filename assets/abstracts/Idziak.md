**Abstract.**
The talk is intended to present latest achievements in searching structural algebraic conditions 
a finite algebra A has to satisfy in order to have a polynomial time algorithm that decides if an equation $$s(x_1,\dots, x_n) = t(x_1,\dots, x_n)$$, where $$s$$ and $$t$$ are polynomials over $$A$$, has a solution in $$A$$.
