**Abstract.**
The talk is intended to present latest achievements in searching structural algebraic conditions 
a finite algebra A has to satisfy in order to have a polynomial time algorithm that decides if an equation s(x₁,...,xₙ) = t(x₁,...,xₙ), where s and t are polynomials over A, has a solution in A.
