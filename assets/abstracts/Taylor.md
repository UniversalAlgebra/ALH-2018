**Abstract.**
For $$L$$ a finite simple lattice, we can examine the class of topological spaces that can support a lattice (with continuous operations) that admits $$$L$ as a 0,1-sublattice. We consider this problem for various modular $$L$$, such as  $M_n$ ($n\geq 3$) and possibly $$M_{p,q}$$. Also a brief look at the distributive case. So far our spaces are small finite geometric examples, very user-friendly.
