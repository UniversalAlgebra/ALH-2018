**Abstract.** The problem of SH-approximation of a semigroup with respect to the predicate of a possible belonging of an element to a subsemigroup is considered. Several explicit conditions for SH-approximation with respect to this predicate are presented. We constructed a special semigroup acting the role of a minimal SH-approximation of semigroup for many predicates. This semigroup has neither identity nor additive identity. It contains an infinite number of idempotents, and the presence of each idempotent is mandatory.
